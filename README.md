# Physics 12 - Mechanics Test

### This program is to hold one problem from every single sub-unit in every unit in part one of Physics 12

##### The program will ask the user out of the options chosen and after confimation is confirmed, will start the test. All questions are the ones I have done irl and are correct, so if there are any errors, then it's probably a small semantic error. 

The Units are:
1. Kinematics,
    * Uniform Motion,
    * Relative Motion,
    * Free Fall,
    * 2D Relative Motion,
    * 2D Projectile Motion,
    * Advance Projectiles.

2. Dynamics,

3. Momentum & Energy,
4. Torque & Equalibrium,
5. Circular Motion & Gravitation.

##### **Press Y or N** for yes or no questions. 


This project is to help me study for my upcoming exam and hopefully it will help you...
