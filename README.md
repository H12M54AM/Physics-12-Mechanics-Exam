# Physics 12 - Mechanics Test

### This program is to hold one problem from every single sub-unit in every unit in part one of Physics 12

##### The program will ask the user out of the options chosen and after confimation is confirmed, will start the test. All questions are the ones I have done irl and are correct, so if there are any errors, then it's probably a small semantic error. 



##### **Press Y or N** for yes or no questions.
